Hi there, I'm calling about an issue with an order I received. I recently purchased a rubber duck from your store, order number 123,456, and it arrived with a hole in it. The hole makes it completely unusable because it can't float properly and keeps filling up with water. I was really looking forward to using it and honestly, it's disappointing to receive a defective product. I'd like to know how we can resolve this. Ideally, I'd prefer a replacement that's in perfect condition, but if that's not possible, I'd like a refund. Could you please assist me with this? Also, let me know if you need photos or any additional details about the issue. Thanks!
